### Engine

The engine is custom, written in C using the venerable [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/index.html) for platform layer stuff (graphics, sound, math, etc).
Most of the core game was written during the challenge, using a few bits of code from a previous similar project.

### Artwork

The artwork was done by a friend of mine, in [aseprite](https://aseprite.org).

### Music and Sound Effects

The music is
[80s Background Music For Videos No Copyright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFQS0OAuy4o) by [Elysium Audio Labs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqHCiiLB8VLvcl5k_Jh86tA).

I made all the sound effects using [rfxgen](https://raylibtech.itch.io/rfxgen).
